# General Iron Bot
[@GeneralIron_Bot](https://twitter.com/GeneralIron_Bot) is a Twitter bot I wrote in Python using the Tweepy API.

## Some Context Behind The Creation Of This Bot
A metal shredder in the city of Chicago known as General Iron has a notorious reputation for violating EPA guidelines and causing excessive air pollution on the area of nearby residents. After a large public outcry from these residents, General Iron has been forced by the city to cease its operations in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. They are now planned to move to the East Side neighborhood of Chicago, a lower-income community that is already overrun with pollution due to its abundance of industrial sites. East Side residents are demanding the city to fulfill their request for clean air, especially because they did exactly that with the more affluent Lincoln Park neighborhood.

## What Does It Do?
In an effort to support the voices of environmental activists, I programmed this bot to automatically reply to every new tweet that Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot makes. It politely reminds Lightfoot of this situation by randomly choosing a reply from a pre-constructed list.
